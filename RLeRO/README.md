## Reinforcement Learning embeded with Robust Optimization (RLeRO): Concept Overview

**Reinforcement Learning embeded with Robust Optimization** is a novel paradigm that synergizes the strengths of **Mathematical Optimization Models** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. By embedding mathematical programming techniques into RL frameworks, RLeRO addresses key challenges in achieving efficient, high-quality decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.

**Challenges**:
   - The problem need to be able to be formulated as a mathematical programming problem.
   - Identifying when and how much optimization guidance is needed without stifling the agentâ€™s exploration.
   - Balancing computational costs, as optimization solvers can be resource-intensive, especially in real-time applications.
